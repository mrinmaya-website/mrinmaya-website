bio: My interests are in building machine learning models for natural language
  processing, knowledge discovery and reasoning. Specifically, I focus on
  machine reading -- on building background knowledge of the world by extracting
  knowledge from text and incorporating the extracted background knowledge to
  solve problems that require reasoning. I am also interested in problems in
  natural language processing and education.

Dr. Mrinmaya Sachan is Assistant Professor of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (ML/NLP) at the Institute for Machine Learning in the Computer Science Department, ETH Zürich. His research interests include building machine learning models for natural language processing, knowledge discovery, and reasoning. Prof. Sachan's research focuses on machine reading - on building background knowledge of the world by extracting knowledge from text and incorporating the extracted background knowledge to solve problems that require reasoning. He is also interested in problems in natural language processing and education.

Before joining ETH Zürich, Dr. Mrinmaya Sachan was Research Assistant Professor at TTI Chicago. He obtained his PhD from the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University where his dissertation research explored how we can build systems that can answer standardized test problems. Standardized tests require AI systems to interpret textual (and visual) input and integrate common-sense knowledge. These problems often require complex reasoning. Prof. Sachan has worked on building models for answering reading comprehension tests as well as other elementary and advanced tests such as the SAT and Advanced Placement (AP) tests that require deep logical or mathematical reasoning along with language understanding. He spent his undergraduate years at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur. He also has industry experience working a couple of years at IBM Research India and have spent summers at Microsoft Research, Redmond and the Allen Institute of AI. During his PhD, he was supported by a number of fellowships: CMLH Fellowship, IBM Fellowship and the Siebel Scholarship.
